ðŸš¨ Important things to note: 

1) You need to ensure the video file you place in the input directory is titled 'My_video.mp4', as specified in the following line of code (for the video to image script):
```py
# Set up video path
video_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/conversion/videoconverter/videoinput/my_video.mp4'
```

3) All the directories can be changed. Using the following code snippet as an example:
```py
# Set up video path
video_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/conversion/videoconverter/videoinput/my_video.mp4'
```

Throughout all scripts a path is set. For usage with google drive the core component of the directory is `/content/drive/MyDrive/...` 
What follows after the initial conponent is up the the user (you). Here are some examples for video output directories:
1) `/content/drive/MyDrive/conversion/videoconverter/finalvideo/`
2) `/content/drive/MyDrive/conversion/videoconverter/bestvideo/`
4) `/content/drive/MyDrive/conversion/videos/`
5) `/content/drive/MyDrive/videos`
6) `/content/drive/MyDrive/edits`
